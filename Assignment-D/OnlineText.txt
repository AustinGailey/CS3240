D123r.  The biggest learning curve for these PDA's was understanding the functionality of the transition function.
        Once the transition function was understood, the pda's were simple.  The first state builds the stack,
        then through a nondeterministic step, we remove all members of the stack.  If the stack is empty at the end,
        then the string is a pallindrome.

        Note: I was able to simplify the DFA's later, by using 1 character input as shown by Sipser


D4r.    This was too easy.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that I have been working with CFG's all semester in PPL.
        The example provided in Sipser was more interesting however I understanding you are checking for understanding here.
        I truly wish that languages were taught in this format.  I believe language shapes how we think and these 
        grammars demonstrate this hypothesis beautifully.
